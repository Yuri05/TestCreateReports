name: Validate qualifications.csv
# Performs a number of checks on the qualifications.csv file.
# - General checks (valid CSV structure, no BOM, UTF-8 encoding, no empty lines).
# - Ensures that every value in the <Execute> column is either TRUE or FALSE.
# - Checks that the OSP qualification plan release given by the combination of the repository name and released version exists.
# - The released version is the chronologically(!) latest available release in the repository (including pre-releases).
# - The workflow name is valid for the combination of <Repository name> and <Released version>:
#   - If empty: "Qualification/workflow.R" must exist in the repository.
#   - If not empty, the given workflow name must exist in the repository.
# - For each folder in the develop branch (excl. those starting with "."), there must be an entry in the <Folder name> column.
